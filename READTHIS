This documentation being developed by NTM Nathan (@ NTM Development) for the Discordeno library.

The guide is not meant to be 100% complete and can contain errors. If any error or suggestion, please make a issues report or a pull request.

Contact me NTM Nathan#0001 on Discord if you really need to. 


Note for NTM Nathan:
Due to Issues with Git (Yes I imported the project). 

Commit and Pull as normal
But push the commits in the CLI with `git push origin master -f` is the only working way atm.
