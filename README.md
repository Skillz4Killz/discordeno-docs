actionText: Start Building →
actionLink: /docs/gettingstarted
features:
- title: Latest and Greatest JavaScript
  details: What is considered the death of code is Backwards Compatibility, it causes clutter and ugliness. Discordeno will not support older versions and always supports the latest versions with the best updates!
- title: Well designed, API
  details: Discordeno eliminates the need for extending built-in classes, inheritances (class and this), EventEmitter, loops, while loops as they do cause many headaches and issues for developers. The functional API is designed for cleanliness, simplicity and a more performant use. 
- title: Security
  details: Checks all permissions necessary before sending a request to the API. This allows for the prevention of supporting self-bots and abusive behaviour.
